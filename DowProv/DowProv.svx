; Title: Dow Cave - Providence Pot system, including Dowbergill Passage

; created 27/10/2015 by Patrick Warren (PBW) from an original by Steve Warren

; Historically Providence Pot was classed as from the entrance to Stalagmite
; Corner, and the rest was classed as Dowbergill Passage (or Dowber Gill
; Passage), part of Dow Cave -- N. Brindle, CPC Journal 2(1), 4-9 (1955).
; The usage here 'Dowbergill Passage' follows Northern Caves vol 1 (1972-9).
; In terms of the survey data, Dowbergill Passage splits naturally at 800 yds
; chamber, where the WRPC re-survey ended in 2004.
 
; Magnetic declinations in individual files were originally calculated
; using the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) model, with
; the online NOAA magnetic declination calculator, for the location
; (WGS84) 54.14929 N, 2.04008 W (Dowbergill Bridge, just above Kettlewell)
; OSGB36 Grid ref: SD 97480 72608  Grid Ref = SD974726
; Location : (OSGB36) Easting = 397480 Northing = 472605
; altitude 225m ODN estimated from spot height on road (Magic Map)
; All these declinations are now commented out, as this method is depracated
; in favour of using the *declination auto command in survex.  However
; it has been verified that both methods generate the exact same
; reduced survey data.
