# QGIS plugin to import survex .3d files

To install, copy the contents of this directory to a new subdirectory
(for example `SurvexImport`) in the main QGIS python plugins directory
(usually `~/.qgis2/python/plugins` where `~` on Windows is probably
`C:\Users\<user>`).

For more details see the main `README.md` in the top level directory.
