# QGIS plugin to import survex .3d files

To install the plugin, clone or download this repository and copy the
the contents of this directory to a new subdirectory (for example
`SurvexImport`) in the main QGIS python plugins directory (usually
`~/.qgis2/python/plugins` where `~` on Windows is probably
`C:\Users\<user>`).

For more details see the main `README.md` in the top level directory.
